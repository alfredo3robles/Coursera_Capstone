    "> Profiling of Boroughs is a big area of research in the real-estate, logistics or even delivery businesses. With this in mind a good and ready available dataset is a must for such research. Fortunately, through webscraping Datasets can be built using various web sources and can be transformed into a relatable dataset.\n",

    "> Philippines, being a country with Barangays inside a municipality rather than Boroughs, makes it difficult to make such profiles. Barangays are not profiled by its capital but by the number of households under it. A good area of research is to profile each barangay and treat it as a Borough and determine business establishments inside it. The idea is to build a dataset that will enable further studies in Maket Research, Capital Research or even Traffic Management by considering key areas and determining features around it.\n",

    ">In this study we will use Python as the primary tool for Data Analysis\n",
    ">### 2.1. Data Collection\n",
    ">>Data was built using Taguig Barangay Zip codes found in [1]. The coordinates of the barangays were retrieved using google maps by buteforce method. Foursquare API was used to get nearby venues along with their coresponding longitude & latitude and venue category (see [2] for the full documentation of Dataset).\n",

    ">\n",
    ">### 2.2. Data Cleaning\n",
    ">>Data was categorized as Food, Recreation, Fitness, Utility and Leisure Amenities according to their venue category provided by Foursquare API. As observed, these venue categories have various inconsistencies such as M lhuillier categorized as a jewelery shop instead of pawnshot so Data Cleaning was required by first Categorizing Venues with accurate venue category then checking each uncategorized amenity. Furthermore, with Foursquare lacking Data on Transportation, Government Building, etc, some venues were uncategorized and dropped as well. See figure 1 for the first 10 rows of the Dataset and [2] for the full documentation.\n",

    ">\n",
    ">### 2.3. KMeans Algorithm & Elbow Method\n",
    ">> Kmeans algorithm will be used for the clustering Venues in Taguig City since the main concern of this clustering will be the distance of each venues. This is the most commonly used algorithm in geosptial Data because it is concerned with minimizing Distances of the points to be considered together with the predetermined clusters.\\\n",
    ">>\\\n",
    ">> Finding the optimal number of clusters in this study is tricky. This is because a lower number of cluster will result to a huge error/distances but increasing it will definitely minimize the error but a zero error/distance would mean no clusters at all. To overcome this problem, the elbow method will be used. Cluster analysis makes use of a heuristic called the Elbow method in determining the amount of distortion a model has with varying number of cluster [3].\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ### 2.4. Exploratory Analysis\n",
    ">>Before segmenting These venues into clusters, the total amenities in taguig were first Determined. This will help in seeing if the number of clusters to be determined is realistic with respect to the optimal number of clusters to be determined using Kmeans. There are a total of 368 total of amenities in Taguig and figure 2 summarizes the number of Amenities in Taguig City per Category.\n",

    ">>\n",
    ">>In order for us to use determine the optimal number of clusters in Taguig, the yellowbrick.cluster package in python was used. Using this package together with the elbow method suffices as the way to determine the optimal number of clusters to be used in KMeans Algorithm since the Data being considered to clustered are longitude and latitudes which requires no distribution analysis. From figure 3 we see that the optimal number of clusters is K=3, this is because it has the least propagated error determined from the running time and least overfitting from the elbow method.\n",

Cluster 2 is expected to have the most number of venues being the cluster covering many barangays. Moreover, CLuster 1 and 3 are borders of Pasay City and Makati respectively.

    "> ### 3.2. Observations and Recommendations\n",
    ">>Further Market research can be done through some observations of the results. For example, it can be observed that most of Businesses in Cluster 1 & 3 are focused only on the main roads unlike in Cluster 2 which is very spread. This means a bigger opportunity for small businesses like minigrocery stores can still be placed in the streets (fine roads as seen in the folium map) of cluster 1 & 3 than in Cluster 2. But on the contrary better GDP will result from a well spread establishments in Cluster thru a higher population target by the said spread.\\\n",
    ">>\\\n",
    ">>This study can also be useful as profile when doing strategic government municipality planning and can still be further developed according to the government needs.\\\n",
    ">>\\\n",
    ">>As for amenities they are profiled into 6 given amenities but by the weakness of foursquare data in the Philippines there is a demand for Foursquare API developers. Developers can still increase accuracy and number of Data in the Philippines. Furthermore, when doing machine learning it is quite useful to have these types of data ready when dealing with geospatial Data."
